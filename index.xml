      <description>‘ajam session is an upcoming workshop on the theme of premodern literary exchange between Persian and Arabic, to be held at the Freie Universität Berlin on 27&amp;ndash;28 October 2022. This is intended to be an uncommon gathering&amp;mdash;perhaps the first of its kind in recent memory&amp;mdash;for scholars who work with textual sources in both Arabic and Persian, and whose research addresses the long interplay between the two literary traditions.
Far too often, classical Persian and Arabic literature have been taught and studied at universities as though they can be siloed.</description>
