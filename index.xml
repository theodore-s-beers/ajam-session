      <description>‘ajam session is an upcoming workshop (still in the planning stages; we are looking for a few more participants) on the theme of premodern literary exchange between Persian and Arabic, to be held at the Freie Universität Berlin on 27&amp;ndash;28 October 2022. This is intended to be an uncommon gathering&amp;mdash;perhaps the first of its kind in recent memory&amp;mdash;for scholars who work with textual sources in both Arabic and Persian, and whose research addresses the long interplay between the two literary traditions.</description>
