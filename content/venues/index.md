## Accommodation

Participants who are coming from out of town will be staying at the
[Seminaris CampusHotel](https://www.seminaris.de/en/hotels/conference-hotel-berlin-dahlem/),
just a few minutes’ walk from the building where our meetings will be held. The
address of the hotel is Takustraße 39, 14195 Berlin.

## Main workshop sessions

All of our meetings on the FU campus will be held in the “Holzlaube” building,
whose street address is Fabeckstraße 23--25. There is a corner entrance at the
intersection of Fabeckstraße and Arnimallee that should be convenient to use.
You may also find it helpful to look at a
[PDF map](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/studium/studienbuero/Flyer-Holzlaube.pdf)
of the building.

The core sessions of the workshop, which will take place between 12:00 and 17:00
on Oct. 27 and 28, will be in room 2.2051.
