## Accommodation

Participants who are coming from out of town will be staying at the
[Seminaris CampusHotel](https://www.seminaris.de/en/hotels/conference-hotel-berlin-dahlem/),
just a few minutes' walk from the building in which our meetings will be held.
The address of the hotel is
[Takustraße 39, 14195 Berlin](https://g.page/seminaris-campushotel-berlin?share).

## Main workshop sessions

All of our meetings on the FU campus will be held in the "Holzlaube" building,
whose street address is
[Fabeckstraße 23--25, 14195 Berlin](https://goo.gl/maps/hSMPm7yYZF3DfLAm9).
There is a corner entrance at the intersection of Fabeckstraße and Arnimallee
that should be convenient to use. You may also find it helpful to look at a
[PDF map](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/studium/studienbuero/Flyer-Holzlaube.pdf)
of the building.

The core sessions of the workshop, which will take place between _ca_. 12:00 and
17:00 on Oct. 27 and 28, will be in room 2.2051.

## Morning reading sessions

On the mornings of Oct. 27 and 28, from 10:00 to 11:30, we will hold informal
"reading sessions," where participants are welcome to bring their own selections
of texts in Persian and/or Arabic, to be read by the group. (This will be a good
opportunity, for example, to examine directly source materials that will be
discussed in a more general manner in workshop presentations.)

These reading sessions will be held on the lower level of the Holzlaube, in room
-1.1062. Please note that printing and photocopying can be done on-site. Those
who wish to contribute need only send documents to
[Theodore Beers](https://www.theobeers.com/links) by email or other means.

## StaBi visit / manuscript viewing

On Wednesday, Oct. 26---the day before the workshop formally begins---those who
are already in town will have the opportunity to visit the
[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin](https://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/) and to view up
close a handful of Persian and Arabic manuscripts from their excellent
collection. The exact time has not been finalized, but it will be in either the
late morning or the early afternoon of that day. This visit has been arranged
thanks to Dr. Yoones Dehghani Farsani.

Please note that the StaBi has two main branches. The relevant one for our
purposes is at
[Potsdamer Straße 33, 10785 Berlin](https://g.page/sbb-berlin?share).
