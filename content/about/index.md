_‘ajam session_ is an upcoming workshop (still in the planning stages; we are
[looking for a few more participants]({{< ref "participants" >}})) on the theme
of _premodern literary exchange between Persian and Arabic_, to be held at the
Freie Universität Berlin on **27--28 October 2022**. This is intended to be an
uncommon gathering---perhaps the first of its kind in recent memory---for
scholars who work with textual sources in both Arabic and Persian, and whose
research addresses the long interplay between the two literary traditions.

Far too often, classical Persian and Arabic literature have been taught and
studied at universities as though they can be siloed. The reality is that these
traditions were inextricably linked from the early Islamic period onward, with
Arabic serving as the overarching _lingua franca_, and with authors of
Persianate background authoring many of the most influential texts in
philosophy, the sciences, _belles lettres_, and beyond---and often writing in
both languages. To attempt to understand the "Perso-Arabic nexus" at the heart
of the Islamicate civilization is difficult. Few researchers have the necessary
training. In fact, two of the rare senior scholars who worked in this niche have
passed away in recent months:
[Julie Scott Meisami](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/news/passing-announced-wolfson-fellow)
and
[Azartash Azarnoush](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/465777/Azartash-Azarnush-member-of-Center-for-Great-Islamic-Encyclopedia).
(_‘ajam session_ will be dedicated informally to their memory.) Again, the main
goal of this workshop is to bring into conversation scholars who wear the hats
of both Arabist and Persianist.

_Funding for this event is provided by the
[Dahlem Junior Host Program](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/sites/dhc/nachwuchs/djhp/)
and the ERC project

are most grateful for their support._
